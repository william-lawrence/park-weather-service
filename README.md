# Park Weather Service

## Introduction
This repo was a team praject that I completed as part of programming bootcamp that I attend. The aim of the project was to show that 
we could build a ASP.NET Core web application.  

It should be noted that we use a limited database for the parks.

## User Stories

1. As a user of the  system, I need the ability to view a list of all parks from the homepage.
	a. The home page should only show a picture of the park, its name, location, and a short summary
2. As a user of the system, I need the ability select a park and view additional details about the selectedpark. All detail described in the Park Data Source needs to be displayed.

3. As a user of the system, once I select a park for viewing I have a way of viewing its 5-day weather forecast. 

4. As a user of the system, I need the ability to change my temperature preference to Celsius or Fahrenheit. 

5. As a user of the system, I need the ability to participate in the daily survey.
	a. Todayâ€™s survey will ask the user to vote on their favorite national park. In additional to selecting a park, they must enter values for a few required fields
		i. E-mail address, state of residence, and physical activity level (inactive, sedentary, active, extremely active).
	b. Once the survey has been submitted and permanently saved for record, the user is redirected to the survey results page where they see which park leads amongst all survey takers
